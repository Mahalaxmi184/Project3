DASHBOARD CONTENT :

KPI's such as

Employee Count : This provides a snapshot of the total number of employees in organization.

Attrition Count : This indicates the number of employees who have left the company.

Attrition Rate : This calculates the percentage of employees who have left, relative to the total employees count.

Average Years : This shows the avg years of the Employees.

Average Age : This shows the average Age of the Employees.

Charts

Attrition by EducationalField:

This donuts chart represents the attrition rate by educationalfields. It helps determine if there are any specific education fields with higher attrition rates.


Number of Employees By Age Group:

By creating age groups using clustered column chart, this bar graph illustrates the distribution of employees across different age ranges. It helps identify age-related trends in workforce.


Job Satisfaction Rate:

The matrix chart showcases job satisfaction ratings for different job roles or positions. It enables us to identify areas of high or low job satisfaction within organization.


Attrition by Salary Slab:

The bar chart represents the attrition rate by Salary Slab. It helps determine if there are any specific SalarySlab with higher attrition rates.


Attrition by JobRole:

This bar graph presents the attrition rates Job Role. It helps determine if there are any JobRole with higher attrition rates.


Attrition Rate Years At Company:

The Line chart show the attrition rates segmented by Years At Company. It provides a visual breakdown of attrition patterns based on attrition and years at company.


Dashboard Overview :
The HR Analytics Dashboard is a powerful Power BI-based tool designed to provide HR professionals with comprehensive insights into key HR metrics and trends. It combines visually appealing and interactive visualizations to enable data-driven decision-making, optimize HR processes, and enhance employee engagement.
